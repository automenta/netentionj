Because reactor water stayed in normal level, operators decided to use HPCI when water level dropped and to control reactor pressure by IC. \n\nAt 15:03, reactor pressure of Reactor 1 dropped so fast and the reactor coolant temperature decreased 55 C per hour, exceeding a criteria in the Tech.Spec. Then operators closed MO-3A and 3B, return isolation valves of IC. IC was in stand-by condition with other valves in the IC remained open. Operators judged that only one train of IC was sufficient to control the reactor pressure in 6 â€“ 7 MPa. They decided to use Train A and started to control the pressure by operating MO-3A.\n\nAs for Reactor 2, RCIC was started manually but tripped because of high reactor water level.

At first, the fire engine pumped up water at the fire protection tank then drove close to the reactor building and injected water through FP line, this operation was repeated because it was considered the elevation at the fire protection tank was too low and the discharge pressure of the pump in the fire engine was not enough. It took significant amount of time to drive the fire engine carefully under the half-collapsed building.\nIt took time to go back and forth the fire engine between the fire protection tank and the reactor building, after some trial and error, continuous water injection started by using a horse equipped on the fire engine to directly connect the fire protection tank and the fire protection line to the RPV.\nAdditional fire engine arrived to the site and this one was used to transport freshwater from the fire protection tank at Reactor 3 to the fire protection tank at Reactor 1 repeatedly. The fire protection tank had room for only one horse, so water injection to the RPV had to be suspended when the second fire engine came to replenish the water in the tank. (Reactor 1)</div>"

However, as restoration work such as road leveling with sandbags and removal of rubbles progressed, the restored traffic between Reactor 3 and Reactor 5/6 allowed us to bring the fire engines from Reactor 5/6. Also, a fire engine prepared as a backup facility for the emergency of Fukushima Daini moved to Fukushima Daiichi. Fire engines for water injection were lined up, sourcing freshwater from fire cistern.\nIn order to inject water by fire engines, it was necessary to decrease the reactor pressure by operating Safety Relief Valve (S/R Valve), but S/R Valve was not able to be operated because batteries had run out. Since batteries in the site were already collected for the restoration of indicators, Reactor 1 and 2, there were no extra batteries in the site.

Residents within a 20 km (12 mi) radius of the Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant and a 10 km (6.2 mi) radius of the Fukushima II Nuclear Power Plant were evacuated. In addition, the U.S. recommended that its citizens evacuate up to 80 km (50 mi) of the plant. (Tsunami)</div>"
